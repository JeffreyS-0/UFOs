# UFOs

## Overview
Welcome to the world of UFO sightings! Our purpose for this analysis is to deploy an interactive webpage that will allow readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. The webpage allows readers to filter the data for specific values related to the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Results
As you can see below, our webpage is easy to read and provides a ton of information.

The table on the bottom of the page contains all of the information regarding UFO sightings.

In order to filter this data, we need to use the 'Filter Search' section on the left. You can simply type in a date, a city, state, country, or shape (or all of the above) to find exactly what you're looking for. For example, if we were to search for all of the UFO sightings that have happened in the state if Texas; then we will type "tx" into the 'State' box and press ENTER. By pressing ENTER, this will automatically run the filter on the table and we will be presented with this below.

## Summary
Our webpage is a pretty basic interface to search and learn about UFO sightings. However, one drawback to this webpage is that it only contains UFO sightings for the first two weeks of January 2010. We can assume that there have been hundreds, if not thousands of UFO sightings over the course of many years. In order to combat this, I would recommend that we continue the development of this webpage by searching for as many UFO sightings as we can and building a similar table to hold that data so we can import that information into our current table on the webpage. We need to be careful with this step because we don't want to accidentally include UFO sightings that are already on our webpage. I would also recommend, that we build a web scrapping tool to pull any new UFO sightings that come to light. By doing this, our webpage would be able to hold a vast amount of historical data and would be constantly updated to show the newest sightings that have occurred.
